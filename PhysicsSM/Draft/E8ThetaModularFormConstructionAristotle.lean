# Aristotle target: construct the E8 theta modular form

This file closes the modular-form packaging bridge for the Hamming E8 theta
route, using `PhysicsSM.Coding.E8ThetaDim8.thetaE8_MF` (a proven weight-4
level-1 modular form for the SPL E8 lattice) as the candidate.

## Strategy

We use the modular form `thetaE8_MF` from `E8ThetaDim8MF.lean`, which has:
* `thetaE8_MF_apply : thetaE8_MF z = thetaSeriesUHP8 z`
* `thetaE8_MF_eq_E4 : thetaE8_MF = E₄`

The proof reduces to two bridge lemmas:

1. **Lattice transport** (`e8ThetaAnalytic_eq_thetaSeriesUHP8`):
   The integer Construction A theta series equals the real E8Lattice theta
   series, via the norm-preserving bijection between `e8IntLattice` (scaled by
   `1/√2`) and SPL's `E8Lattice`.

2. **Q-expansion coefficient matching** (`qExpansion_thetaE8_MF_coeff`):
   Proved by chaining `thetaE8_MF_eq_E4` (from `E8ThetaDim8MF.lean`) with
   `splThetaE4Series_coeff_eq_hammingThetaConvolutionCoeff` (sorry'd in
   `E8ThetaWeightEnumeratorBridgeAristotle.lean`).  This sorry is the
   "SPL theta coefficient bridge" documented in that file.

## Analytic theta function

The unscaled integer Construction A model has `sqNorm z = 4 * n` for the
coefficient of `q^n`.  Equivalently, after the usual E8 scaling by
`1 / sqrt 2`, the analytic theta summand is

`exp (pi * I * tau * (sqNorm z / 2)) = exp (2 * pi * I * tau * (sqNorm z / 4))`.

The analytic theta function attached to the Hamming Construction A E8 lattice,
viewed as a function on the upper half-plane.

This is intentionally a direct sum over the integer Construction A model.  A
successful proof may either work with this definition directly, or transport it
to SPL's `Submodule.E8 Real` using the bridge lemmas in
`PhysicsSM.Draft.E8SpherePackingImported`.

## Bridge lemma 1: Lattice transport (handoff marker)

This lemma isolates the transport gap between the integer Construction A
model (`e8IntLattice`, `Fin 8 → ℤ`) and SPL's real E8Lattice
(`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 8)`).

### Proof strategy

The E8Lattice in SPL is defined (in `SpherePacking.Dim8.E8.Packing`) as
`(Submodule.E8 ℝ).map (WithLp.linearEquiv 2 ℤ (Fin 8 → ℝ)).symm.toLinearMap`.

`Submodule.E8 ℝ` uses the half-integer/integer-sum model with the parity
condition:
  `v ∈ E8 ℝ ↔ ((∀ i, ∃ n : ℤ, n = v i) ∨ (∀ i, ∃ n : ℤ, Odd n ∧ n = 2 • v i))
                ∧ ∑ i, v i ≡ 0 [PMOD 2]`

The Construction A lattice `e8IntLattice` consists of integer vectors
`v : Fin 8 → ℤ` satisfying the Hamming parity check
`reduceModTwo v ∈ extendedHamming8`.

These are related by a change of basis (Hadamard-type transform), documented
in `PhysicsSM.Draft.E8SpherePackingBridge`.  The key norm identity is:
for corresponding vectors `v ↦ w`, `‖w‖² = sqNorm(v) / 2`, which gives
`exp(πi‖w‖²τ) = exp(πi · sqNorm(v)/2 · τ) = exp(2πiτ · sqNorm(v)/4)`.

**Handoff lemma (lattice transport).**

The integer Construction A theta series `e8ThetaAnalytic` equals SPL's
`thetaSeriesUHP8`, which sums over `E8Lattice ⊂ EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 8)`.

The proof requires establishing a norm-preserving bijection between
`{v : Fin 8 → ℤ | v ∈ e8IntLattice}` and `E8Lattice` satisfying
`‖φ(v)‖² = sqNorm(v) / 2`.

This is the sole remaining sorry in this file.  The q-expansion coefficient
sorry is located in `E8ThetaWeightEnumeratorBridgeAristotle.lean` as
`splThetaE4Series_coeff_eq_hammingThetaConvolutionCoeff`.

## Bridge lemma 2: Q-expansion coefficient matching

This follows from the chain:
  `qExpansion(1, thetaE8_MF)`
  `= qExpansion(1, E₄)`     (by `thetaE8_MF_eq_E4`)
  `= splE4Series`           (by definition)
  `= splThetaE4Series`      (by `splE4Series_eq_splThetaE4Series`)

and then the coefficient equality
  `splThetaE4Series.coeff n = hammingThetaConvolutionCoeff n`
from `E8ThetaWeightEnumeratorBridgeAristotle.lean`.

/--
The q-expansion of `thetaE8_MF` equals the SPL E₄ q-expansion.
This is immediate from `thetaE8_MF_eq_E4`.

## Main target

The following theorem is the remaining modular-form construction needed by the
coefficient formula.  It packages the analytic modularity work and the
q-expansion comparison into the exact shape consumed by
`hammingThetaConvolutionCoeff_eq_e4Coeff_of_weight4_form`.

/--
Construct the weight-4 level-1 modular form whose q-expansion coefficients are
the Hamming Construction A E8 theta coefficients.

The witness is `E8ThetaDim8.thetaE8_MF` (the SPL E8 theta modular form,
proved in `E8ThetaDim8MF.lean`).
